        Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime
        environment that runs on a JavaScript Engine (i.e. V8 engine) and
        executes JavaScript code outside a web browser, which was designed to
        build scalable network applications. Node.js lets developers use
        JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side
        scripting—running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page
        content before the page is sent to the user's web browser. Consequently,
        Node.js represents a "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm,[6] unifying
        web-application development around a single programming language, rather
        than different languages for server-side and client-side scripts.
        Node.js has an event-driven architecture capable of asynchronous I/O.
        These design choices aim to optimize throughput and scalability in web
        applications with many input/output operations, as well as for real-time
        Web applications (e.g., real-time communication programs and browser
        games).[7] The Node.js distributed development project was previously
        governed by the Node.js Foundation,[8] and has now merged with the JS
        Foundation to form the OpenJS Foundation, which is facilitated by the
        Linux Foundation's Collaborative Projects program.[9]

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>
      Ryan Dahl, creator of Node.js, in 2010 Node.js was written initially by
      Ryan Dahl in 2009,[24] about thirteen years after the introduction of the
      first server-side JavaScript environment, Netscape's LiveWire Pro Web.[25]
      The initial release supported only Linux and Mac OS X. Its development and
      maintenance was led by Dahl and later sponsored by Joyent.[26] Dahl
      criticized the limited possibilities of the most popular web server in
      2009, Apache HTTP Server, to handle a lot of concurrent connections (up to
      10,000 and more) and the most common way of creating code (sequential
      programming), when code either blocked the entire process or implied
      multiple execution stacks in the case of simultaneous connections.[27]
      Dahl demonstrated the project at the inaugural European JSConf on November
      8, 2009.[28][29][30] Node.js combined Google's V8 JavaScript engine, an
      event loop, and a low-level I/O API.[31] In January 2010, a package
      manager was introduced for the Node.js environment called npm.[32] The
      package manager makes it easier for programmers to publish and share
      source code of Node.js packages and is designed to simplify installation,
      updating, and uninstallation of packages.[31] In June 2011, Microsoft and
      Joyent implemented a native Windows version of Node.js.[33] The first
      Node.js build supporting Windows was released in July 2011. In January
      2012, Dahl stepped aside, promoting coworker and npm creator Isaac
      Schlueter to manage the project.[34] In January 2014, Schlueter announced
      that Timothy J. Fontaine would lead the project.[35] In December 2014,
      Fedor Indutny started io.js, a fork of Node.js. Due to the internal
      conflict over Joyent's governance, io.js was created as an open governance
      alternative with a separate technical committee.[36][37] Unlike
      Node.js,[38] the authors planned to keep io.js up-to-date with the latest
      releases of the Google V8 JavaScript engine.[39] In February 2015, the
      intent to form a neutral Node.js Foundation was announced. By June 2015,
      the Node.js and io.js communities voted to work together under the Node.js
      Foundation.[40] In September 2015, Node.js v0.12 and io.js v3.3 were
      merged back together into Node v4.0.[41] This merge brought V8 ES6
      features into Node.js and a long-term support release cycle.[42] As of
      2016, the io.js website recommends that developers switch back to Node.js
      and that no further releases of io.js are planned due to the merge.[43] In
      2019, the JS Foundation and Node.js Foundation merged to form the OpenJS
      Foundation. In September 2022, Node.js 18.9.0 was released.[44]
