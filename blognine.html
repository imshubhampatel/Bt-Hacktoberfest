      <p>
        React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a free and open-source
        front-end JavaScript library[3] for building user interfaces based on UI
        components. It is maintained by Meta (formerly Facebook) and a community
        of individual developers and companies.[4][5][6] React can be used as a
        base in the development of single-page, mobile, or server-rendered
        applications with frameworks like Next.js. However, React is only
        concerned with state management and rendering that state to the DOM, so
        creating React applications usually requires the use of additional
        libraries for routing, as well as certain client-side
        functionality.[7][8]

    <h2>Virtual DOM</h2>
    <p>
      Another notable feature is the use of a virtual Document Object Model, or
      virtual DOM. React creates an in-memory data-structure cache, computes the
      resulting differences, and then updates the browser's displayed DOM
      efficiently.[11] This process is called reconciliation. This allows the
      programmer to write code as if the entire page is rendered on each change,
      while the React libraries only render subcomponents that actually change.
      This selective rendering provides a major performance boost.[12] It saves
      the effort of recalculating the CSS style, layout for the page and
      rendering for the entire page.[12]

    <h2>JSX</h2>
    <p>
      JSX, or JavaScript Syntax Extension, is an extension to the JavaScript
      language syntax.[13] Similar in appearance to HTML, JSX provides a way to
      structure component rendering using syntax familiar to many developers.
      React components are typically written using JSX, although they do not
      have to be (components may also be written in pure JavaScript). JSX is
      similar to another extension syntax created by Facebook for PHP called
      XHP.

    <h2>React hooks</h2>
    <p>
      Hooks are functions that let developers "hook into" React state and
      lifecycle features from function components.[17] Hooks do not work inside
      classes — they let you use React without classes.[18] React provides a few
      built-in hooks like useState,[19] useContext, useReducer , useMemo and
      useEffect.[20] Others are documented in the Hooks API Reference.[21]
      useState and useEffect, which are the most commonly used, are for
      controlling state and side effects respectively.
