    <p>Now the Web standards curriculum has taken you through the core essential concepts of programming, it is time to take a step back from the details and take a high-level look at what you can actually do with JavaScript — why would you want to take the time to learn such a complicated subject, and use it on your web pages? <br>

        Computers used to be much slower and browsers were bad at interpreting JavaScript. Most developers came from a back-end development world. Back then, JavaScript just seemed like a bad idea.<br>
        
        On the other hand, the cost of hosting files was very high. This is where JavaScript came in: JavaScript is executed on users’ computers when they access the page, meaning that anything you can do in JavaScript will not add processing strain onto your server. Hence, it is client-side. This made sites much more responsive for the end user and less expensive in terms of server traffic.
        <br>
        

        Skip forward to  for today – modern browsers have well-implemented JavaScript, computers are much faster, and bandwidth is a lot cheaper, so a lot of the negatives are less critical. However, cutting down on server round-trips by doing things in JavaScript still results in more responsive web applications and a better user experience.
        <br>
        
        <h2> downside JavaScript</h2>
        Even with all these improvements, there is still a catch: JavaScript is flaky. Not the language itself but the environment it is implemented in. You do not know what computer is on the receiving end of your web page, you do not know how busy the computer is with other things, and you do not know if some other JavaScript in another tab of the browser is grinding things down to a halt. Until browsers begin having different processing resources for different tabs and windows (also known as threads), this will always remain an issue. Multiple threading is made available to a certain degree by a new HTML5 feature called Web workers, and this has reasonable browser support.
