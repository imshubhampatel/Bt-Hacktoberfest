    <h1>Speciality of CSS</h1>

    <h2>Here is something to read..</h2>

    <p>CSS or ‘Cascading Style Sheet’ tells how HTML elements are to be displayed on the web page. It’s an easy way to control the style of a web page, as at once you can change all the paragraph styles, font style, the headers, background colors etc. CSS has come in many different versions over the years. The first level (level 1) was released in 1996 and then built on with level 2 which came out in 1998. Level 3 is being developed at the moment.

        <h2>Why CSS....?</h2>
        In essence CSS is a freely available standard, sticking to W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) rules and describes a document’s presentation using a markup language. It is now incredibly popular with website owners for creating a page that looks great. The main idea behind it is that the presentation of a site is managed and coded separately from the content of the site which has a major time advantage of being able to change the presentation of multiple pages in one single process. <br>
        The roots of the idea of formulating CSS go back to a proposition by Håkon Wium Lie on October 10, 1994. Lie was working with Tim Berners-Lee at the time at CERN. There were several other styles that were suggested but CSS became very popular. In all the discussion about different styles, the ‘cascading’ approach in CSS let page managers change multiple sheets or pages at the same time. <br>
        <h2>Browser supports</h2>
        There were indeed other models that other people were trying to develop at the time. Pei Wei developed a language that derived from the Viola browser and Robert Raisch who worked for the publishing house O’Reilly had managed to put another model together. DSSSL was another model that was a possibility at the time. However, the beauty of the idea of CSS was that it was a partnership between the reader and the web writer. In other words it was the idea that the style of the document could not just be designed by the writer or the reader by themselves, the needs and wishes of both had to be taken into account. The capability of the device that was displaying the content was also absolutely vital in the design.
   <h2>Why we need CCS</h2>
   CCS is a climate game-changer. It is one of the few technologies able to adequately displace CO2 from coal and gas-fired power stations
   and the only technology capable of reducing large-scale emissions from myriad industrial sources.
   CCS also has the unique capacity to be retrofitted to many existing complexes to allow them to function cleanly for the term of their
   natural <br>
   The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and International Energy Agency (IEA) have both evidenced the critical role that CCS must
   play in meeting global emissions reduction <br>
   Through cleaning old industry and giving it a second life, CCS is preserving jobs and keeping local economies alive.
   Most significantly, CCS is starting to demonstrate its climate change prowess in delivering commercial returns in a new energy economy
   where hydrogen production and bioenergy are starting to gain traction.
