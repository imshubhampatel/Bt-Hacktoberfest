    <p>CSS or ‘Cascading Style Sheet’ tells how HTML elements are to be displayed on the web page. It’s an easy way to control the style of a web page, as at once you can change all the paragraph styles, font style, the headers, background colors etc. CSS has come in many different versions over the years. The first level (level 1) was released in 1996 and then built on with level 2 which came out in 1998. Level 3 is being developed at the moment.
