        HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It allows the user to create and structure sections, paragraphs, headings, links, and blockquotes for web pages and applications. <br>
        HTML is not a programming language, meaning it doesn’t have the ability to create dynamic functionality. Instead, it makes it possible to organize and format documents, similarly to Microsoft Word. <br>        
        Hypertext means a text that contains references to other texts that viewers can access immediately. <br> He published the first version of HTML in 1991, consisting of 18 HTML tags. Since then, each new version of the HTML language came with new tags and attributes (tag modifiers) to the markup.
        According to Mozilla Developer Network’s HTML Element Reference, currently, there are 140 HTML tags, although some of them are already obsolete. <br>
        Due to a quick rise in popularity, HTML is now considered an official web standard. <br> The HTML specifications are maintained and developed by the World Wide Web Consortium. You can check out the latest state of the language anytime on W3C’s website.

        HTML documents are files that end with a .html or .htm extension. You can view then using any web browser (such as Google Chrome, Safari, or Mozilla Firefox). The browser reads the HTML file and renders its content so that internet users can view it.
        Usually, the average website includes several different HTML pages. For instance: home pages, about pages, contact pages would all have separate HTML document.        
        Below, you can see a code example of how HTML elements can be structured.</p>
